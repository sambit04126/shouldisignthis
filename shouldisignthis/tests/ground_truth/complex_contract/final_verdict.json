  "summary": "This contract is fundamentally unserious and unconscionable. It contains numerous clauses that are absurd, predatory, and legally unenforceable, including illusory payment terms, a perpetual non-compete, impossible termination conditions, and a nonsensical dispute resolution jurisdiction. The agreement is so grotesquely one-sided that it cannot be considered a good-faith basis for any professional relationship. It must be rejected outright without consideration for negotiation, as it would need to be rewritten in its entirety.",
  "key_factors": [
    "The payment terms are illusory and effectively constitute unpaid labor.",
    "The perpetual non-compete, overly broad IP assignment, and impossible termination clause for 'The Peasant' are unconscionable and unenforceable.",
    "The combination of unlimited liability, unreasonable indemnification, and a non-existent legal jurisdiction ('Galactic Empire') creates unacceptable and absurd risk."
  ],
  "negotiation_points": [
    "The contract is beyond negotiation and requires a complete redraft using a standard industry agreement as a starting point.",
    "Introduce commercially reasonable payment terms, a standard IP clause limited to work product, and a mutual termination clause with fair notice periods.",
    "Define a legitimate governing law and jurisdiction, and include a standard limitation of liability clause."
