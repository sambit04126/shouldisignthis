      "explanation": "The contract includes a 90-day warranty against material defects. In a Time & Materials (hourly) engagement, the Consultant is paid for effort. This clause shifts the engagement toward a Fixed-Price model where the Consultant must fix bugs for free (uncompensated time) up to 3 months after delivery. Hourly consultants should generally bill for all time spent, including bug fixes, unless the error was due to gross negligence."

      "explanation": "Disputes are forced into binding arbitration in San Francisco. If the Consultant is not based in SF, travel costs to defend a claim may be prohibitive. Furthermore, binding arbitration often precludes Small Claims Court, which is the most cost-effective way for a freelancer to collect unpaid invoices under $10k."

      "deviation_type": "UNFAVORABLE",
      "explanation": "With monthly invoicing and Net 30 terms, the Consultant faces a ~60-day delay between the start of work and the first payment. For independent contractors, Net 15 or 'Due on Receipt' is preferred to minimize cash flow strain."

      "explanation": "Contractually mandating strict technical metrics ('>80% code coverage') creates a breach of contract risk if the specific architecture or project constraints make this unfeasible. It is safer to rephrase this as a goal or 'best efforts' obligation rather than a hard requirement."
