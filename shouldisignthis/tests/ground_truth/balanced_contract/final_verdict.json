  "confidence": 88,
  "summary": "This is a standard consulting agreement with clear and fair terms regarding payment, IP, and termination. However, there are three medium-risk items that warrant negotiation before signing. The dispute resolution venue is potentially costly for the consultant, the deliverable review period is short, and the 90-day warranty creates a post-delivery liability. These points are not deal-breakers but should be addressed to create a more balanced and favorable agreement for the consultant.",
  "key_factors": [
    "The contract contains well-defined standard clauses for payment, IP assignment, and termination.",
    "The identified risks (dispute venue, review period, warranty) are all moderate and represent common points of negotiation.",
    "The presence of a standard liability cap (limited to 12 months of fees) is a significant positive countermeasure."
  ],
  "negotiation_points": [
    "Propose changing the binding arbitration venue to a neutral location or the consultant's home city.",
    "Request an extension of the deliverable review period from 5 business days to 10-15 business days to allow for more thorough feedback.",
    "Negotiate the 90-day warranty to be more specific, limiting it to fixing bugs in the delivered code rather than covering all 'material defects'."
