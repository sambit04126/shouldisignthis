      "deviation_type": "UNFAVORABLE",
      "explanation": "The contract doesn't specify who owns the intellectual property created during the consulting services. This ambiguity could lead to disputes over ownership of deliverables, source code, and other work product, potentially resulting in the client claiming ownership of the consultant's creations."

      "explanation": "The contract does not specify a method for resolving disputes (e.g., arbitration, mediation, or litigation venue). This omission could lead to increased costs and uncertainty in the event of a disagreement, potentially forcing the service provider to litigate in an unfavorable jurisdiction."
