      "explanation": "The client has only 5 days to review the deliverables (Frontend React App, Backend Python API, Documentation). This is a very short review window, potentially leading to rushed or incomplete reviews and unfair acceptance/rejection decisions. A more reasonable acceptance period would be 10-14 days."

      "deviation_type": "UNFAVORABLE",
      "explanation": "Payment terms of Net 15 are relatively short. Net 30 is more standard and gives the client sufficient time to process invoices without causing undue cash flow issues for the contractor. Net 15 puts pressure on the contractor, especially for larger invoices."

      "explanation": "The Mutual Indemnification clause only covers claims arising from 'negligence.' It doesn't cover other potential liabilities like breach of contract, intellectual property infringement, or other types of harm. While mutual indemnification is present, its limited scope means that the contractor may be exposed to liabilities beyond those arising from their own negligence without reciprocal protection from the client."

      "explanation": "The liability cap does not apply to gross negligence or willful misconduct. This means the contractor has unlimited liability for these actions. While the client should be protected from gross negligence and willful misconduct, unlimited liability represents a significant risk to the contractor and should be carefully considered. Consider negotiating a higher, but capped, liability for these exceptions."
