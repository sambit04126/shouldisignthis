      "deviation_type": "UNFAVORABLE",
      "explanation": "The clause stating 'You are responsible for everything' exposes the Consultant to unlimited liability, which is a major risk. The Consultant could be held personally responsible for damages exceeding the value of the contract. A reasonable liability cap, such as the total fees paid under the agreement, is needed."
    },
    {
      "risk": "Unilateral Termination Clause",
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "page": 1,
      "risk_type": "UNFAVORABLE_TERM",
      "deviation_type": "UNFAVORABLE",
      "explanation": "The clause stating 'We can fire you. You can't quit.' is extremely unfavorable. The Consultant is bound to the contract but the other party can terminate at will. This needs to be revised to allow the Consultant to terminate with reasonable notice (e.g., 30 days) and to include termination for cause with a cure period."

    {
      "risk": "Vague Payment Terms",
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "page": 1,
      "risk_type": "UNFAVORABLE_TERM",
      "deviation_type": "UNFAVORABLE",
      "explanation": "The clause stating 'We will pay you what we think is fair, eventually.' is unacceptable. It lacks specific payment amounts, payment schedules, or clear criteria for determining payment. This needs to be replaced with defined payment terms including rates, invoicing procedures, and payment due dates. The lack of defined terms creates a high risk of non-payment or delayed payment."

    {
      "risk": "Undefined Dispute Resolution",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "page": 1,
      "risk_type": "MISSING_CLAUSE",
      "deviation_type": "NON_STANDARD",
      "explanation": "The contract lacks a dispute resolution clause. This omission means that any disputes will default to the court system, which can be costly and time-consuming. A clause specifying mediation or arbitration in a convenient location is recommended."
    },
    {
      "risk": "Missing Effective Date",
      "severity": "LOW",
      "page": 1,
      "risk_type": "MISSING_CLAUSE",
      "deviation_type": "NON_STANDARD",
      "explanation": "The contract does not specify an effective date. While seemingly minor, this can create ambiguity as to when the contract begins and its duration. Adding an effective date clarifies the start of the contractual obligations."
