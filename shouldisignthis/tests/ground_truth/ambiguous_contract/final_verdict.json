  "summary": "This contract is fundamentally unserious and dangerously one-sided. It exposes the consultant to unlimited liability, contains unenforceable payment terms, and imposes a unilateral termination clause that traps the consultant. Key standard clauses are missing, and the obligations are not defined. The document as written is unprofessional and presents an unacceptable level of risk. It should be rejected outright and replaced with a standard, professionally drafted agreement.",
  "key_factors": [
    "Three 'CRITICAL' risks: Unlimited Liability, Vague Payment Terms, and Unilateral Termination.",
    "The complete lack of specificity, fairness, and mutual obligation.",
    "The absence of essential clauses such as Dispute Resolution and an Effective Date."
  ],
  "negotiation_points": [
    "This document is not a basis for negotiation; request a complete redraft using a standard consulting agreement.",
    "Introduce a standard Limitation of Liability clause, capped at the fees paid under the agreement.",
    "Define specific payment rates, invoicing procedures, and net payment days (e.g., Net-30)."
