  "summary": "This contract is fundamentally unconscionable and legally hazardous. It attempts to establish a relationship of involuntary servitude by expressly forbidding you from quitting, while simultaneously offering an illusory promise of payment ('what we think is fair') that likely renders the agreement unenforceable. Combined with unlimited liability exposure ('responsible for everything'), this document provides no protection, no guaranteed income, and infinite risk.",
  "key_factors": [
    "Illusory Payment Terms: 'Pay what we think is fair' provides no legal guarantee of compensation.",
    "Forced Labor Clause: The prohibition on resignation ('You can't quit') is unethical and likely illegal.",
    "Unlimited Liability: Absolute responsibility for all damages is a bankruptcy-level risk."
  ],
  "negotiation_points": [
    "Demand specific, enforceable payment terms (e.g., $X/hour, Net 30).",
    "Require a mutual termination clause allowing you to exit with notice (e.g., 30 days).",
    "Implement a market-standard liability cap (e.g., limited to Fees Paid)."
