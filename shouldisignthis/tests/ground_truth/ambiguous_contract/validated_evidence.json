      "explanation": "The clause stating 'We can fire you. You can't quit.' is extremely unfavorable. The Consultant is bound to the contract but the other party can terminate at will. This needs to be revised to allow the Consultant to terminate with reasonable notice (e.g., 30 days) and to include termination for cause with a cure period."

It lacks specific payment amounts, payment schedules, or clear criteria for determining payment. This needs to be replaced with defined payment terms including rates, invoicing procedures, and payment due dates. The lack of defined terms creates a high risk of non-payment or delayed payment."
