    "email_body": "Dear [Opposing Party Name],\n\nThank you for sharing the agreement with us. After careful review, we have some requests to ensure that it aligns with industry standards and fairly represents both parties' interests. \n\nSpecifically, we propose the following changes:\n\n*   **Payment Terms:** We recommend redrafting the payment terms to reflect fair market value and incorporate a standard payment schedule. This will ensure clarity and predictability for both of us.\n*   **Non-Compete Clause:** To provide some protection, a non-compete clause that is reasonable in scope, geographically limited, and has a defined time period should be put in place.\n*   **Critical Clauses:** We must insist on replacing the intellectual property, termination, and indemnification clauses with industry-standard language. This is crucial to protect our respective interests and mitigate potential risks.\n\nWe are confident that these adjustments will strengthen the agreement and create a mutually beneficial partnership. We are open to discussing these points further and finding mutually agreeable solutions. Please let us know when you are available to discuss this further. \n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]"
