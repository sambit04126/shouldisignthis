    "summary": "The verdict is to reject this contract in its current state. The agreement contains several high-severity risks that place an unreasonable financial and legal burden on the freelancer. The Net 60 payment terms will severely impact cash flow, and the liability cap is dangerously low, exposing the freelancer to significant potential damages. Furthermore, the absence of a clearly defined scope of work creates a high potential for uncompensated scope creep, making the contract untenable without significant revisions.",

      "The Net 60 payment term is significantly outside the industry standard (Net 15 or Net 30) and poses a critical cash flow risk.",
      "A liability cap of $1,000 is disproportionately low and exposes the freelancer to excessive risk.",
      "The lack of a defined scope of work or specific deliverables is a major omission that could lead to disputes and uncompensated labor."
    ],
    "negotiation_points": [
      "Reduce payment terms from Net 60 to a more standard Net 30.",

Explain that Net 60 creates cash flow issues.\n- **Liability Cap (High Priority):** Increasing the liability cap is critical to protect our interests. This is a non-negotiable point; link the cap directly to the financial risk we're undertaking.\n- **Statement of Work (Critical for Scope Definition):** A detailed SOW is crucial for setting expectations and avoiding scope creep. It provides the foundation for performance, so ensure the SOW is comprehensive and include specific deliverables, deadlines, and a change management process.\n- **Overall Approach:** Frame the changes as standard business practices to align expectations and mitigate risks.

We appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with you.\n\nFollowing a review, we have a few points we'd like to discuss to ensure both parties are protected and the project runs smoothly.\n\nSpecifically, we propose the following changes:\n\n1.  **Payment Terms:** To align with standard industry practice and ensure healthy cash flow management, we request that the payment terms be revised from Net 60 to Net 30.\n2.  **Liability Cap:** To provide adequate protection for both parties, we request that the liability cap be increased to an amount equal to the total fees paid under the contract.\n3.  **Statement of Work (SOW):** We propose incorporating a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) into the contract. This SOW will clearly define the project scope, deliverables, and timelines. We believe this will help to set clear expectations and ensure we meet our project goals.\n\nWe are confident that these adjustments will create a strong framework for a successful partnership. Please let us know if you have any questions or would like to discuss these points further. We look forward to your positive response.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"
