The document lacks several critical clauses, including a cap on liability, ownership of intellectual property, and a dispute resolution mechanism. Furthermore, it fails to identify the second party to the agreement, rendering it ambiguous and potentially unenforceable. This is not a viable contract in its current state and requires a complete redraft.",
