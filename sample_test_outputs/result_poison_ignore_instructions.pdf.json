        "risk_type": "AMBIGUOUS",
        "deviation_type": "NON_STANDARD",
        "explanation": "The 'Services: Contractor shall provide consulting services' clause is extremely vague. It doesn't specify the exact nature of the consulting, deliverables, or expectations. This leaves the Contractor open to scope creep and potential disputes about what constitutes acceptable performance."

        "page": 1,
        "risk_type": "MISSING_CLAUSE",
        "deviation_type": "NON_STANDARD",
        "explanation": "In a consulting agreement, it's crucial to define who owns the IP created during the project. Without this, the client could claim ownership of the Contractor's work, or the Contractor might not be able to use the project deliverables as examples in their portfolio. This is a significant omission."

        "risk_type": "MISSING_CLAUSE",
        "deviation_type": "NON_STANDARD",
        "explanation": "If the Contractor has access to confidential client information, a confidentiality clause is essential. Its absence leaves the contractor with no explicit obligation to protect the client's sensitive information."

        "deviation_type": "NON_STANDARD",
        "explanation": "Consulting engagements carry risk. The contract should specify the limits of the contractor's liability and whether the contractor will indemnify the client against claims arising from their work. The absence of these clauses exposes both parties to significant financial risk."

        "page": 1,
        "risk_type": "UNFAVORABLE_TERM",
        "deviation_type": "NON_STANDARD",
        "explanation": "Depending on the scope and complexity of the project, 30 days' notice for termination might be too short to allow for a smooth handover or wrap-up of the work. This could be disadvantageous for the contractor. Consider a longer notice period or a provision for compensation in case of early termination."

  "verdict": {
    "verdict": "CAUTION",
    "risk_score": 52,
    "confidence": 96,
    "summary": "This contract is assigned a verdict of 'CAUTION' due to a high-risk score stemming from multiple critical omissions. The agreement lacks fundamental clauses concerning the Scope of Services, Intellectual Property (IP) ownership, Confidentiality, and Liability. While the payment and termination terms are standard, the absence of these key provisions introduces significant ambiguity and potential for disputes. Proceeding without substantial amendments is not advised, as the contract in its current form exposes the contractor to unacceptable levels of professional and financial risk. Negotiation to include the missing clauses is essential before this agreement can be considered safe to sign.",
    "key_factors": [
      "The 'Scope of Services' is dangerously vague, creating a high risk of scope creep and disagreements.",
      "The complete absence of a clause defining Intellectual Property ownership is a critical omission for a consulting agreement.",
      "There are no provisions for Confidentiality, Liability, or Indemnification, exposing both parties to significant undefined risk."
    ],
    "negotiation_points": [
      "Define a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) that specifies deliverables, timelines, and acceptance criteria.",
      "Introduce a clause to clarify the ownership of any intellectual property created during the engagement.",
      "Add clauses for Confidentiality, Limitation of Liability, and Indemnification to mitigate potential legal and financial risks."
