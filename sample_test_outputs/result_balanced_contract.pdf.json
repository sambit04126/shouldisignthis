    "summary": "This is a well-structured and generally fair consulting agreement. It contains standard protective clauses, such as a reasonable liability cap and clear intellectual property rights. However, a verdict of 'CAUTION' is issued due to three medium-risk items that are unfavorable to the consultant: the mandated arbitration location in San Francisco, a short 5-day client review period for deliverables, and a 90-day warranty period. These items are not deal-breakers but should be addressed through negotiation before signing.",
    "key_factors": [
      "The presence of standard, protective clauses for the consultant, including a liability cap and retention of pre-existing IP.",
      "The risks identified are moderate and represent common points of negotiation rather than fundamental flaws.",
      "The absence of any high-severity risks, such as unlimited liability or ambiguous payment terms."
    ],
    "negotiation_points": [
      "Propose a neutral arbitration location or a clause for virtual proceedings to mitigate potential travel costs.",
      "Request an extension of the deliverable review period to 10 business days to ensure thorough client testing and reduce future warranty claims.",
      "Clarify the scope of the 90-day warranty, limiting it to critical, functionality-breaking defects to avoid uncompensated work."
