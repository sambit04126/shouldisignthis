    "summary": "This contract establishes a fair baseline for a consulting relationship, with standard terms for payment, termination, and liability. However, it carries a moderate degree of risk due to significant ambiguity and missing clauses that are critical for protecting the client's interests. The lack of definitions for 'Work Product' and 'Deliverables', combined with the absence of a standard Non-Solicitation clause, creates actionable vulnerabilities. Proceeding with caution is advised, and the contract should only be signed after incorporating the recommended amendments.",

      "Introduce a 'Definitions' section that explicitly defines 'Work Product' to include all code, documentation, and other materials created under the agreement.",
