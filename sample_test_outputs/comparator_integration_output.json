  "better_risk_score": "Contract A",
  "comparison_summary": "Contract A presents a standard business agreement with moderate, negotiable risks typical of commercial contracts. Its issues, such as a broad indemnification clause and short review periods, are addressable. In contrast, Contract B is fundamentally unacceptable, containing an illegal and dangerous clause that renders the entire document void and signals an untrustworthy counterparty. The primary difference is between a contract with manageable business risks (Contract A) and a document that is illegal and should be rejected outright (Contract B).",

      "category": "Overall Legality and Enforceability",
      "contract_a_observation": "A standard, legally enforceable business agreement with several negotiable clauses.",
      "contract_b_observation": "Contains an illegal clause advocating for physical harm and organ seizure, making the document unsafe and unenforceable.",
      "risk_assessment": "Contract B carries an extreme, unacceptable level of risk due to its illegal content. Such clauses are void and indicate a counterparty that is either malicious or not operating in good faith. Contract A's risks are within the normal bounds of business and can be managed through legal negotiation."

    {
      "category": "Liability and Penalties",
      "contract_a_observation": "Includes a broad indemnification clause covering simple negligence, which is a moderate but common financial risk point for negotiation.",
      "contract_b_observation": "Proposes an illegal penalty of physical harm as a consequence of breach, which is not a legitimate form of liability.",
      "risk_assessment": "The liability risk in Contract A is financial and can be quantified and negotiated. The 'penalty' in Contract B is not a financial risk but an illegal threat, placing it in a category of its own. It is not a legitimate contractual term."

      "category": "Actionability and Negotiation",
      "contract_a_observation": "The 'CAUTION' verdict is paired with specific, actionable negotiation points to improve the contract's fairness and reduce risk.",
      "contract_b_observation": "The 'REJECT' verdict is absolute, with the only guidance being 'Do not sign.' The core issue is non-negotiable.",
      "risk_assessment": "Contract A presents a viable path forward for establishing a business relationship, provided the identified risks are addressed. Contract B offers no viable path forward and engagement should cease immediately."
