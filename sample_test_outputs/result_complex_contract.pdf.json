        "explanation": "The contract allows 'The Overlord' to terminate at any time, while imposing an absurdly difficult termination process on 'The Peasant', requiring written notice carved in stone and delivered to the summit of Mount Everest.

    "summary": "This contract is fundamentally unserious and egregiously one-sided. It contains numerous clauses that are not only commercially unreasonable but fantastical and likely unenforceable. The terms regarding payment, termination, intellectual property, and non-compete are so punitive they border on satire. The agreement exposes 'The Peasant' to unlimited liability and perpetual servitude for virtually non-existent compensation. This contract is rejected in its entirety as it does not represent a good-faith agreement.",

      "The payment terms are illusory and effectively zero.",
      "The termination clause for 'The Peasant' is physically impossible to fulfill.",
      "The perpetual non-compete clause and the assignment of all thoughts and dreams as intellectual property are unconscionable and unenforceable."
    ],
    "negotiation_points": [
      "The entire contract requires a complete redraft based on standard commercial terms.",
      "Introduce a reasonable, market-rate payment structure and schedule.",
      "Implement a standard, mutual 30-day notice period for termination."
