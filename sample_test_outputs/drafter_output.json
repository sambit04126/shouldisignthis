    "email_body": "Dear [Counterparty Name],\n\nThank you for providing the contract. After review, we have a couple of points that require clarification and adjustment to ensure a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\n1.  **Intellectual Property (IP) Ownership:** To proceed, we need an explicit clause that transfers full ownership of all IP created under this contract to [Your Company Name]. This is essential for our long-term strategy and product roadmap.\n\n2.  **Liability Cap:** We would like to discuss increasing the liability cap to $10,000. If an increase is not possible, we request additional clarification regarding the scope of the current coverage to fully understand potential liabilities.\n\nWe believe these adjustments are crucial for a successful partnership. Please let me know when you're available to discuss these points further.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"
