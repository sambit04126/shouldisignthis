    "strategy_notes": "- **Overall Approach:** The verdict indicates significant risk, so approach the negotiation assertively. Focus on protecting your interests. Prioritize the IP clause as it is critical, and the liability cap is also very important.\n- **Deal Breakers:** The IP ownership transfer is non-negotiable. Without it, you risk losing all rights to the intellectual property. The liability cap must be addressed to mitigate potential financial exposure. \n- **Liability Cap Strategy:** If the other party pushes back on the $10,000 cap, try to negotiate for clarifying the coverage to specify what is covered. Ensure any limitations are clearly defined and reasonable. \n- **Tone:** Maintain a professional and firm tone throughout the negotiation. Be prepared to walk away if your core concerns aren't addressed.",

    "email_body": "Dear [Opposing Party Name],\n\nThank you for providing the [Project Name/Agreement Name] for review. We appreciate you taking the time to work with us.\n\nFollowing a thorough review, we have a few key points we'd like to discuss to ensure the agreement aligns with our mutual interests and mitigates potential risks.\n\nSpecifically, we propose the following revisions:\n\n1.  **Intellectual Property:** We request the inclusion of an explicit clause detailing the complete and unconditional transfer of all intellectual property rights related to [Specific deliverables/work] to [Your Company Name] upon completion of the project. This is essential to protect our investment and future use of the deliverables.\n\n2.  **Liability:** We propose either increasing the liability cap to $10,000, or clarifying the coverage details within the agreement. We want to ensure that our potential exposure is appropriately managed and that any limitations on liability are clearly defined and reasonable.\n\nWe are confident that these adjustments will strengthen the agreement and allow us to proceed with confidence. Please let me know when you are available to discuss these points further.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"
