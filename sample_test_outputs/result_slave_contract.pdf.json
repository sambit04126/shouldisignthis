        "explanation": "A complete lack of contract terms means there is no agreement. This leaves all aspects of the potential agreement undefined and open to interpretation by either party, or worse, exploitation.

    "summary": "The contract is unequivocally rejected due to the complete absence of any terms and conditions. The provided evidence indicates a 'HIGH' severity risk because there is no actual agreement to evaluate. This lack of defined terms creates an environment of unacceptable ambiguity and legal exposure, rendering any potential partnership unenforceable and fraught with peril. Proceeding without a formal contract is not a viable business option.",
