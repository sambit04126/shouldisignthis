Dispute Resolution: To mitigate potential disputes, we propose adding a clause specifying a method for resolution, such as mediation or arbitration. This will provide a clear process for addressing disagreements efficiently and cost-effectively.\n\n2.  Effective Date: To avoid any ambiguity, we request that a specific Effective Date be included to clarify when the contract's terms officially commence.\n\n3.  Invoicing Process: Given the Net 30 payment term, we would appreciate further clarification on the invoicing process, including preferred methods for invoice submission and any required supporting documentation. This will ensure timely and accurate payments.\n\nThank you for your attention to these matters. We believe these adjustments will contribute to a stronger and more transparent agreement. Please let me know when you're available to discuss these points further.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"
