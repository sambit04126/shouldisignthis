While many terms such as the hourly rate, IP ownership, and termination clause are standard and fair, there are three significant points of concern that heavily favor the client. The liability cap is exceptionally low, exposing the freelancer to substantial uncovered risk. The Net 60 payment terms can create cash flow problems, and the ambiguous scope of work opens the door to 'scope creep' without additional compensation. Therefore, proceeding with caution is advised, and the freelancer should not accept the agreement without significant negotiation on these key points.",

We believe a cap of [Specify amount, e.g., $25,000] is a reasonable standard for this type of agreement and provides adequate protection for both parties.\n*   **Payment Terms:** We would like to request a revision to the payment terms from Net 60 to Net 30. This aligns with our standard payment practices and improves cash flow management.\n*   **Statement of Work (SOW):** To ensure a clear understanding of the project scope and deliverables, we propose including a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) addendum. This addendum would clearly define the project deliverables, timelines, and key milestones.\n\nWe are confident that addressing these points will strengthen the contract and provide a solid foundation for a successful partnership.
