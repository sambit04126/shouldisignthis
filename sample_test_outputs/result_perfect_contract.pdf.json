        "deviation_type": "NON_STANDARD",
        "explanation": "This gives the client very little in return for such high payments. A non-exclusive and revocable license severely limits the value the client gets from the work and allows the developer to potentially sell the same work to others simultaneously. Coupled with the lack of client termination rights, this puts the client at a massive disadvantage."

        "deviation_type": "NON_STANDARD",
        "explanation": "While beneficial for the developer, the 50% *daily* interest is a predatory rate and may not be legally enforceable. It also suggests that the client may have cashflow issues and be unable to make payments. This increases the risk for the developer."

    "summary": "This contract is fundamentally unbalanced and poses an extreme and unacceptable level of risk to the Client. The terms are extraordinarily one-sided in favor of the Developer, stripping the Client of basic commercial protections such as the ability to terminate, recourse for non-performance via liability, and ownership of the intellectual property for which they are paying an exorbitant fee. The agreement lacks commercial reasonableness to such a degree that it should be rejected outright.",

      "The complete indemnification of the Developer by the Client for all matters, which is an extreme and non-standard shifting of risk.",
      "The Developer's liability is capped at $0.00, offering no recourse for negligence, misconduct, or failure to deliver.",
      "The Client has no right to terminate the agreement, effectively locking them into a potentially perpetual and damaging relationship."
    ],
    "negotiation_points": [
      "Introduce a mutual termination clause, allowing the Client to terminate for cause at a minimum.",
      "Replace the $0.00 liability cap with a reasonable figure (e.g., total fees paid) and limit the indemnification clause to third-party claims resulting from the Developer's direct negligence.",
      "Revise the intellectual property clause to grant the Client full ownership or, at the very least, an exclusive, perpetual, and irrevocable license to the work product."
