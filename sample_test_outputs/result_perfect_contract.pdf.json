        "deviation_type": "UNFAVORABLE",
        "explanation": "The Client has only 5 days to review deliverables. This might not be sufficient time for thorough testing and feedback, especially for complex software projects. A longer acceptance period (e.g., 10-15 days) would be more reasonable."

        "deviation_type": "NON_STANDARD",
        "explanation": "Each party indemnifies the other only against claims arising from their *own* negligence. This is a fairly narrow indemnity. A broader indemnification clause (e.g., covering all claims related to the services, or arising from breach of contract) is more typical and would offer better protection for the Contractor. If the client is more likely to be sued due to the contractor's work, and the contractor's negligence is hard to prove, it leaves the contractor exposed."

        "deviation_type": "UNFAVORABLE",
        "explanation": "While a liability cap exists, the exception for gross negligence and willful misconduct could potentially expose the contractor to significant liability. The definition of gross negligence is often subjective, and a client could argue that even a mistake rises to that level, thereby circumventing the liability cap. It is better to negotiate a clearer definition, or to have a higher cap."

        "deviation_type": "UNFAVORABLE",

    "summary": "This contract presents a mixed risk profile. While its foundational elements like intellectual property rights and termination clauses are standard and fair, it contains several terms highly unfavorable to the contractor. The aggressive Net 15 payment schedule, the ambiguous and high-risk exception for 'gross negligence' in the liability cap, and the short deliverable review period collectively create significant financial and legal exposure. These issues are substantial enough to warrant a 'CAUTION' verdict, and the contract should not be signed in its current form without material revisions.",

      "The liability cap's exception for 'gross negligence' creates a potential loophole for unlimited liability.",
      "Net 15 payment terms are unusually short and pose a significant cash flow risk to the contractor.",
      "The 5-day acceptance period for deliverables is insufficient for thorough testing and could lead to disputes."
    ],
    "negotiation_points": [
      "Extend payment terms from 'Net 15' to a minimum of 'Net 30' to align with industry standards.",
      "Define 'gross negligence' more precisely or remove it as an exception to the liability cap.",
      "Increase the client's acceptance period for deliverables from 5 days to at least 10 business days."
