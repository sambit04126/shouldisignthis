    "confidence": 86,
    "summary": "The verdict is to proceed with caution. The primary risk is the complete absence of a clause specifying the transfer of intellectual property ownership, which is a high-severity issue that leaves the client without ownership of the final work product. A secondary, medium-severity risk is the liability cap of $5,000, which may be insufficient to cover potential damages. While the cap is noted as standard for small projects, the IP ownership issue must be rectified before acceptance.",
    "key_factors": [
      "No IP ownership transfer specified (HIGH severity)",
      "Liability limited to $5,000 (MEDIUM severity)",
      "Lack of key clauses poses significant future risk"
    ],
    "negotiation_points": [
      "Add a clause that explicitly transfers all intellectual property rights to the client upon final payment.",
      "Negotiate a higher liability cap that is commensurate with the potential damages.",
      "Request a clear 'Work for Hire' clause to solidify IP ownership status."
