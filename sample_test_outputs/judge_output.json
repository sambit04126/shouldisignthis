    "summary": "This contract is rejected due to a critical, unaddressed flaw. The complete absence of a clause transferring intellectual property (IP) ownership to the client is a fundamental deficiency. While the liability cap is explained, it does not mitigate the fact that the client would be paying for a work product they do not legally own. This single issue presents an unacceptable business risk, rendering the contract unfit for execution in its current state.",
    "key_factors": [
      "Critical failure to transfer intellectual property (IP) ownership to the client.",
      "The highest severity risk is entirely unaddressed by any counter-arguments.",
      "Risk of paying for work product without legal ownership or rights to use it."
    ],
    "negotiation_points": [
      "MUST ADD: An 'Assignment of Intellectual Property' or 'Work for Hire' clause that unequivocally transfers all rights for the completed work to the client upon final payment.",
      "The $5,000 liability cap should be re-evaluated to ensure it is commensurate with the total project value and potential damages.",
      "Request a mutual indemnification clause to protect against third-party claims arising from the work."
