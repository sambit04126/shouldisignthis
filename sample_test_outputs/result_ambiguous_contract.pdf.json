        "explanation": "The contract states 'We will pay you what we think is fair, eventually.' This is unacceptably vague.

        "explanation": "The contract states 'You are responsible for everything.' This is a term for unlimited liability. The consultant is responsible for any and all damages.

It contains multiple critical flaws, including unlimited liability, undefined payment terms, and a unilateral termination clause. The language is unprofessional and the terms are dangerously one-sided. This document is not a viable starting point for a professional engagement and should be rejected outright.",

    "negotiation_points": [
      "Demand a complete rewrite of the agreement based on a standard professional services contract.",
      "Introduce a clear Limitation of Liability clause that caps potential damages to a reasonable amount (e.g., total fees paid).",
