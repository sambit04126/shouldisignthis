It is grossly unprofessional and exposes the consultant to an unacceptable level of risk due to ambiguous and unfavorable terms regarding payment, termination, intellectual property, and key obligations. The agreement lacks the fundamental clarity and fairness required for a professional engagement and should not be signed in its current form under any circumstances. A complete rewrite is necessary.",

      "Introduce specific, measurable payment terms: Define project fees or hourly rates, invoicing schedule, and a standard payment period (e.g., Net 30).",
